### Pre-requisites:

- Node v16.x
- Nodemon
  - install nodemon globally using `npm install -g nodemon`

### Setting up the app

In the backend folder:

- npm install
- npm start

In the frontend folder:

- npm install
- npm start

After running the above commands, the app should open on port 3001.
For now there's not much to see, but you can confirm that things are working by checking if there is an array of launches being logged to the browser console.
Don't worry if the tests are failing for now.
